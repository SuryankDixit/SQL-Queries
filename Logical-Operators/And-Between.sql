-- 1.Write a query that returns all the orders where the standard_qty is over 1000, the poster_qty is 0, and the gloss_qty is 0.
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE standard_qty > 1000 AND poster_qty = 0 AND gloss_qty = 0;



-- 2. Using the accounts table, find all the companies whose names do not start with 'C' and end with 's'.
SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'C%' AND name LIKE '%s';



-- 3. When you use the BETWEEN operator in SQL, do the results include the values of your endpoints, or not? Figure out the answer to this important question by writing a query that displays the order date and gloss_qty data for all orders where gloss_qty is between 24 and 29. Then look at your output to see if the BETWEEN operator included the begin and end values or not.
-- End Points are included in between
SELECT occurred_at, gloss_qty 
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_qty BETWEEN 24 AND 29;


-- 4. Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the organic or adwords channels, and started their account at any point in 2016, sorted from newest to oldest.
select *
from web_events
where channel='organic' or channel='adwords' and occurred_at between '2016-01-01' and '2017-01-01'
order by occurred_at desc;



select *
from web_events
where (channel like 'organic' or channel like 'adwords') and occurred_at between '2016-01-01' and '2017-01-01'
order by occurred_at desc;


SELECT *
FROM web_events
WHERE channel IN ('organic', 'adwords') AND occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC;
